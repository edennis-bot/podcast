# Questions for Ed and Tarek

1. Why can't people agree on how to define Artificial Intelligence or what counts as AI? I guess part of this comes down to having to define intelligence, which gets a bit philosophical.
2. According to Neil Lawrence at the University of Cambridge, it would be more appropriate to call a lot of today's AI technology "computers and statistics". What's he getting at?
3. Do you think that when the general public hear "AI" or "Artificial Intellligence", they're thinking of Terminator or The Matrix and other films like that, or is proliferation of AI news articles changing people's views?
4. Nowadays a lot of algorithms used for the kind of data science and statistics problems you guys work on are being grouped under the umbrella term "Machine Learning" or "ML". Is this categorisation helpful, or is it another definition problem like AI we'd need an entire podcast episode on?
5. I've heard the term "narrow AI" before, is that one you're familiar with?
6. The Alan Turing Institute, where we all work, is the UK national institute for data science and AI; What's the definition of AI that makes most sense in *our* context as researchers? I think listeners should bear mind your answer when we talk about specific research projects in future episodes.
