# Questions for Ed and Tarek

- According to Neil Lawrence at the University of Cambridge, it would be more appropriate to call a lot of today's AI technology "computers and statistics". What's he getting at?
- Do you think that when the general public hear "AI" or "Artificial Intellligence", they're thinking of Terminator or The Matrix and other films like that, or is proliferation of AI news articles changing people's views?
- Nowadays a lot of algorithms used for the kind of data science and statistics problems you guys work on are being grouped under the umbrella term "Machine Learning" or "ML". Is this categorisation helpful, or is it another definition problem like AI we'd need an entire podcast episode on?
- The Alan Turing Institute, where we all work, is the UK national institute for data science and AI; What's the definition of AI that makes most sense in our context as researchers?
