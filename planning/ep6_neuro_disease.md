Q's for Bea

**Image analysis in neurodegenerative disease**

1. What happens when we age? What’s happening to the brain cells, the neurons.
2. Why are neurons like spaghetti?
3. What’s an axon and why is it difficult to work out how curvy they are?
4. Image recognition is a hot topic in AI research. How does your research make use of the advances in this field?
5. How good is the software you’ve developed at categorising neurons?
7. Do the drosophila flies you use have as many kinds of neurons as us or get the same diseases?
8. Are the neurodegenerative diseases causing the neurons to be spaghetti, or the other way around? If we found out how to un-spaghetti neurons, would this cure alzheimers and other neurodegenerative diseases?
