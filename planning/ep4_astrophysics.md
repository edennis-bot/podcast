# Intro

We are chatting with Tarek Allam and Gordon Yip who are PhD candidates in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London.

## Media round-up

### Powerful antibiotics discovered using AI - nature

- The new antibiotic is called Halicin, a drug originally being investigated as a treatment for diabetes, which has been shown to kill a variety of disease causing bacteria, including some that are resistant to current antibiotics
- Researchers at MIT discovered Halacin by training a neural network to spot molecules that prevent the growth of E.coli, then using it to predict whether drugs not intended to be used as antibiotics, could in fact inhibit E.coli
- When Halacin was tested in mice, it's been shown to have a low toxicity and appears to be something that bacteria can't easily develop resistance to



# Questions

## For Tarek

PhD research looks at classification of supernova light curves to help constrain theories of Dark Energy.

1. What is a Supernova and why are astrophysicists interested in classifying them?
2. At The Turing Podcast, we're interested in how the era of big data is changing science. When it comes to Astronomy, how big does the data get?
3. What's dark energy and how does your research on supernovas relate to it?

## For Gordon

PhD research looks at the atmosphere of remote exo-planets through the use of machine learning techniques.

1. Exoplanets are any planet that exists outside the solar system. Do you have an idea of how many have been discovered these days or how fast they're being discovered?
2. What can you tell us about the atmospheres of exoplanets and how are you using machine learning to find out more?
3. How comparable are some of these exoplanets to the planets in the solar system that we're all familiar with?

## For both

1. As experts in astrophysics and astronomy, what's your opinion on the question of are we alone in the universe?
