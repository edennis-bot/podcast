# Questions

### Effie

- You created an app called Fluphone back in 2011, tell us a little about that and how similar initiatives during the current crisis could work.
- Smartphones have changed a little since 2011 when you worked on Fluphone. What features of current phones do you think could be useful in tracking Covid-19?
- So far, developments around policy in relation to Covid19 have been rather rapid - You wrote a post on The Turing blog about just over a week ago, but I imagine things have changed even since then?
- What is your perspective on the privacy concerns arising from apps that track the spread of the virus and similar technologies during the pandemic?
- How have you been continuing your work since the lockdown?

### Ed

- What are the challenges associated with using mobile phone tracking in terms of the reliability of data?
- Have you seen the Covid 19 symptoms tracker app developed by Kings College London and partners? (https://covid.joinzoe.com/)
- How organised are data science research communities in your opinion, both nationally and internationally? Is there some chance that the proliferation of initiatives to track spread and record data will have a lot of overlap, thereby reducing the uptake of any single system?
