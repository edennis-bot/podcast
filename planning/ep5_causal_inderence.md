# Intro

We are chatting with Peter Tennant, a data scientist based at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics who is also a fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His research focuses on methods for what's known as "causal inference", a data science philosophy that's transforming fields such as social science and epidemiology.

## Media round-up

### [BBC - AI ethics backed by Pope and tech giants in new plan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51673296)

- IBM and Microsoft have announced they are teaming up with the Pope and The Catholic Church to "work on" ethical considerations of AI
- It's not clear from this article what they will actually do
- An amusing quote from Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft: "I don't think it will be easy to develop a singular approach to ethics for machines since we haven't been able to do it for people".
- We're planning a later episode of The Turing Podcast on AI and data ethics, so stay tuned!

# Questions

1. It seems pretty obvious that scientists should be interested in finding out what causes, say as disease, rather than just what's associated or correlated with it. Why has that not always been the case?
2. How does outside knowledge affect how we look at correlations in data and why might "AI" not be best placed to make sensible assumptions?
3. Why is there an interest in new methods for causal inference now, where do you see it heading as a scientific field?
4. Why do you think causal inference requires a different philosophy to predictive science?
5. Why is there a reproducibility crisis in science?
6. What was the "birth weight paradox"?


Bonus q:

Do you think that we'll be able to build better AI and general AIs when causal inference matures as a scientific field or discipline?
