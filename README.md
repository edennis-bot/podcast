Alan Turing Institute/ REG team Podcast Ideas
=====

### Who is it for?
1. General public? - Leaning to this
2. Data scientists?

### What is the purpose?
1. Public outreach
2. Researchers about their Turing research
3. Talk about Turing goals and science being done

### What is it about?

Data science and AI topics, ask the experts.

Episode ideas:
1. "What is AI?" with James G
2. "ML applications to the blockchain" with Tim
3. Pick a news story from the week (see comms team summary) and discuss with an expert
4. Reproducibility and The Turing Way (about the book)
5. Digital twins
6. Project pages
7. REG blog
8. Data science projects - practical things
9. Ethics related stuff

### What is the format?
1. Interview style
2. Length?
3. Stories including multiple interviews
4. Regular schedule
5. But some flexibility for breaking stories

### Who is in charge of it and who are the interviewers?

2. Tarek?
3. Ben
4. Kelly Ryan?
5. Dan Whitfield - Technical stuff
6. This could be a test podcast

### Who are the interviewees?

3. Other data scientists and software engineers?
4. James G
5. Radka
6. Sarah
7. Specific people who want to talk about themes

### How to get people to talk?
1. Pick themes
2. Ask them on slack etc

### Themes
1. General: What is AI

2. Can they provide interview training
3. Talk to Dan tech
4. Talk to Beth/Jo (interview techniques)

### Podcast name ideas
1. Turing Complete
2. TuringCast
3. The Turing Way
4. The Turing Time Series
5. Random Variables

7. Something related to a Turing quote

### Where should it be available?
1. Google podcasts
2. Spotify
3. SoundCloud
4. YouTube
5. Institute website
6. Apple
7. To begin with, could have a GitHub pages site generated from the repo with just a homepage and SoundCloud widgets for the episodes and links to all of the other podcast streaming services
