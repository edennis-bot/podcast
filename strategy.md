# The Turing Podcast: Global Domination Strategy

## 2020

### Q1

1. Record as many episodes as possible with Turing scientists
2. Begin to release episodes at a regular schedule
3. Interview someone at AI UK
4. Get at least one extra regular (scientist) co-host

### Q2

1. Continue momentum and include episodes from some more senior people at Turing
2. Get one interview with someone outside Turing
3. Get even more co-hosts. Reach a point where Ed could leave and it continues.

### Q3/Q4

1. Get several outside interviews with science people that have a relatively large online following
2. Cover some other events:
    - New Scientist Live
    - RSE con?
3. Reach out to some other AI/tech podcast hosts for an episode, to really boost the podcast (can do remote video chat) e.g. Lex Fridman (AI podcast)
